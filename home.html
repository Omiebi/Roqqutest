    <hi>Hi Guys! My name is Omi and I love love love to read. I recently resumed back at reading after taking a break to do someother things.<br>
        I have been looking forward to reading a book titled "THE ALCHEMIST". <br>
        A friend of mine recently hooked me up with a site on my i-books and I am so excited because I get to satisy my cravings..lol,<br>by reading and guess what there's a maximum of five free downloads per day, isn't that interesting and exciting</hi>
